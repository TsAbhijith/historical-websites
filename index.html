      <ul>
        <li>
          The Taj Mahal, also known as the “Crown of the Palace,” is an ivory-white marble mausoleum situated on the
          right bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. Here are some fascinating details about this
          iconic monument:
        </li>

        <h3>Construction and Purpose:</h3>
        <li>
          Commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, the Taj Mahal was built to house the tomb of
          his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also serves as the final resting place for Shah Jahan himself.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mausoleum is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
          house. The entire project employed around 20,000 artisans under the guidance of the emperor's court
          architect, Ustad Ahmad Lahori.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although the construction of the main mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, work continued on other
          phases for another 10 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first ceremony held at the Taj Mahal was an observance by Shah Jahan on February 6, 1643, marking the
          12th anniversary of Mumtaz Mahal's death. Thousands of mourners attended the event.

      <h2>Humayun's Tomb</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Humayun's Tomb, also known as Maqbara-i Humayun, is a magnificent Mughal garden tomb situated in Delhi, India. Let's explore its captivating history and architectural significance:
        </li>
        <h3>Foundation and Design:</h3>
        <li>
          Commissioned by Empress Bega Begum, the first wife and chief consort of Mughal Emperor Humayun, the tomb was built in 1558.
        </li>
        <li>
          The architects Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, both Persian, were chosen for this grand project.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent and marked a departure from earlier Mughal architecture.
        </li>
        <h3>Location and Materials:</h3>
        <li>
          Humayun's Tomb is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, close to the Dina-panah Citadel (also known as Purana Qila or Old Fort), which Humayun founded in 1538.
        </li>

        <li>
          The India Gate, formerly known as the All India War Memorial, stands as a solemn tribute to the valor and sacrifice of Indian soldiers who lost their lives during the First World War. Let's explore this monumental structure:
        </li>
        <h3>Design and Location: </h3>
        <li>
          Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the India Gate evokes the architectural style of ancient Roman triumphal arches.
        </li>
        <li>
          It stands near the Kartavya path on the eastern edge of New Delhi's ceremonial axis, formerly called Rajpath.
        </li>
        <li>
          The gate's grandeur is reminiscent of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.
        </li>
        <h3>Historical Significance: </h3>
        <li>
          The India Gate commemorates 74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who made the ultimate sacrifice between 1914 and 1921.
        </li>

          The gate bears 13,300 inscribed names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom.
        </li>
        <h3>Amar Jawan Jyoti: </h3>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          It consists of a black marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and surrounded by four eternal flames.

          The Red Fort, also known as the Lal Qila, is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighborhood of Delhi, India. It holds immense cultural and architectural significance and has played a central role in India's history.
        </li>
        <h3>Construction and Purpose:</h3>
        <li>
          Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Red Fort on May 12, 1639, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Originally adorned with red and white hues, its design is credited to the architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.

          The Red Fort lies along the Yamuna River and features impressive red sandstone walls.
        </li>
        <li>
          It served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unfortunately, during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739, the fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of the fort's marble structures were later demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, the fort's defensive walls remained largely intact.
        </li>
        <h3>Independence Day Tradition:</h3>
        <li>
          On August 15, 1947, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every year on India's Independence Day, the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolor flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.

      <img src="Qutub-minar.jpg" alt="Qutub Minar">
      <h2>Qutub Minar</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Qutb Minar, also spelled as Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, stands tall as a minaret and a “victory tower” within the Qutb complex. This complex lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. Here are some intriguing details about this remarkable structure:
        </li>
        <h3>Height and Steps:</h3>
        <li>
          The Qutb Minar reaches an impressive height of 72.5 meters (238 feet).
        </li>
        <li>
          It consists of a whopping 399 steps that spiral upward.
        </li>
        <h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site:</h3>
        <li>
          The Qutb Minar is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was mostly built between 1199 and 1220.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interestingly, it can be compared to the 62-meter all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, which was constructed around the same time.
        </li>
        <h3>Architectural Marvel:</h3>
        <li>
          The Qutb Minar showcases elements of traditional Islamic architecture and southwestern Asian design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its shaft is fluted with superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies at the top of each stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike typical minarets, which are often detached from the main mosque, the Qutb Minar stands as a central marker and a reminder of Islam's presence in the area.
        </li>
        <li>
          The intricate decorations on its surface include inscriptions and geometric patterns.
        </li>
        <h3>Illumination and Celebrations:</h3>

          In recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions involving international relations.
        </li>
        <li>
          For instance, it was lit up in the colors of the Mexican flag to celebrate Mexico's 213th Independence Day in September 2023.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, the monument was illuminated with the Turkish flag to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey in October 2023.

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Gateway of India, completed in 1924, stands as an iconic landmark on the waterfront of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. Notably, George V was the first British monarch to visit India.
        </li>
        <h3>Design and Architecture:</h3>
        <li>
          The Gateway of India is a memorial arch made of basalt, soaring 26 meters (85 feet) high.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its architectural style combines elements of a triumphal arch with Gujarati architecture from the 16th century.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final design by architect George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924.
        </li>
        <li>
          The structure overlooks the Arabian Sea and stands at an angle opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel.
        </li>
        <h3>Historical Significance:</h3>
        <li>
          Initially, the Gateway served as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important government personnel.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1948, it witnessed a significant moment when the last British troops in the Army of India departed, following the British withdrawal from India.
        </li>
        <li>
          Today, the Gateway of India is synonymous with Mumbai and remains one of its prime tourist attractions.

        <li>
          The Hawa Mahal, also known as the Palace of the Winds, is a captivating palace in the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. Let's explore its fascinating details:
        </li>
        <h3>Construction and Purpose:</h3>
        <li>
          Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of Jaipur, the Hawa Mahal is a masterpiece.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inspired by the unique structure of the Khetri Mahal, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh commissioned this grand palace.
        </li>
        <li>
          The architectural design was executed by Lal Chand Ustad.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its five-story exterior resembles a honeycomb, adorned with 953 small windows called Jharokhas, intricately decorated with latticework.
        </li>
        <li>
          Originally, these lattice windows allowed royal ladies to observe street life and festivities without being seen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The design also facilitated the Venturi effect, allowing cool air to pass through during scorching summers.
        </li>
        <h3>Unique Facts:</h3>
        <li>
          Many people mistakenly assume that the Hawa Mahal's street-facing side is the front, but it is actually the back.
        </li>
        <li>
          The monument's façade features a mass of semi-octagonal bays, creating its distinctive appearance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each porthole has miniature windows, carved sandstone grills, finials, and domes.
